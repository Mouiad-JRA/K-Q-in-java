# K-Q-in-java

A Karnaugh map (KM or K-map) is a way to simplify a Boolean algebra expression.
When using a Karnoff map, the desired logical results are transferred from the truth table to a two-dimensional grid


# The suloution

When solving Boolean equations with n variables we simplify these equations to the simplest possible form.
There are several laws used in Boolean algebra to simplify equations such as the laws of substitution, 
the laws of integration in the process of separation and connection, the complement rule for the complement, 
the first and second absorption rules, and De-Morgan theorems, which are considered to be the most important theorems in Boolean algebra, 
but there are other ways to simplify these equations (gates) to a simpler form In a simpler way, sometimes a complex equation can be simplified 
using Boolean algebra with ten gates, and the simplification steps are very complex, and at the same time, there are easier ways to do this with 
less than the previous number of gates.
Here we have a new way to simplify equations and logic gates easier is karnaugh map which is an efficient way to simplify equations up to 6 variables.


# The Aim of the project

The goal of the project is to implement the previous solution of a Markov map using Java and JavaFX.


# The Output

To Run the Project jsut clone it and download JAVA 10 then run the run.ex file and follow this demo
