# K-Q-in-java

When solving Boolean equations with n variables we simplify these equations to the simplest possible form.
The laws of Boolean algebra are used to simplify equations such as the laws of substitution, the laws of integration in the process of separation and connection, the rule of complement for the complement, the first and second absorption rules, and De-Morgan theorems, which are considered the most important theorems in Boolean algebra, but there are other ways to simplify these equations (gates) to a simpler and simpler form in Sometimes a complex equation can be simplified using Boolean algebra with ten gates, and the simplification steps are very complex, and at the same time, there are easier ways to do this with less than the previous number of gates.

# A Karnaugh map
(KM or K-map) is a way to simplify a Boolean algebra expression. When using a Karnoff map, the desired logical results are transferred from the truth table to a two-dimensional grid

# Getting Started

This project is a JAVA App depends on java and javaFX

This project aims to demonstrate the practical application of Karnoff Map using Java
